# Contact Manager

Contact Manager is a sample application built using `React` and `Redux` with `Reduxigen`. It was built to showcase how you can build an application using `Reduxigen`.

Contact Manager has two screens: 

* Contacts
* Contact Details

It uses the JSON Placeholder Test API for its backend. While this API exposes methods that produce side effects (like POST), no side effects are ever produced by it. It is always static. No data ever changes.
